        the 'action' property of the 'form' tag tells the browser where to send
            the data contained within the form when the user clicks on a button
        the 'method' property of the 'form' tag denotes how the data should be sent
            the two options are POST and GET.
            GET requests send the data through the URL - less data can be sent with GET requests, and they are clearly visible to the user
            POST requests send the data through a series of separate packets - more data can be sent with POST requests, and the data is invisible to the user

    <!-- To prevent the form submission when the button is clicked
          - You can use event.preventDefault()
          - You can change the type attribute of the button from "submit" (the default) to "button". This change ensures that clicking the button won't trigger form submission.
